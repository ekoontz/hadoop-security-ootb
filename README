Getting Started
---------------

These scripts run on pre-existing remote hosts. Create your master and slave instances first.
Take note of the IP addresses of the $MASTER and $SLAVE.

pushd . ; cd .. ; scp -r hadoop-security-ootb $MASTER: ;  popd
ssh $MASTER "./hadoop-security-ootb/bin/start-master.sh"

for each slave $SLAVE:

pushd . ; cd .. ; scp -r hadoop-security-ootb $SLAVE: ;  popd
ssh $SLAVE "export MASTER=$MASTER ./hadoop-security-ootb/bin/start-slave.sh"

Design
------

The top-level scripts mentioned above (start-master.sh and start-slave.sh), have the following dependencies:

start-master.sh
|
|\
| `shutdown.sh
|\
| `setup-master.sh
|  |
|  |`-krb5.sh
|  |
|  |`-setup-hadoop-config.sh
|  |
|  `-permissions.sh
|\
| `-start-hdfs-master.sh
 \
  `-start-yarn-master.sh


start-slave.sh
|
|\
| `-shutdown-slave.sh
|\
| `-setup-slave.sh
|\
| `-start-hdfs-slave.sh
 \
  `-start-yarn-slave.sh
